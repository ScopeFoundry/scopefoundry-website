The following is a list of hardware component plug-ins created for use with ScopeFoundry. If you have a device you would like to use with ScopeFoundry and it is not listed below, you can create a custom hardware plug-in [from the following instructions](/docs/11_tools-tutorials/2_hardware-1/)

This page periodically crawls GitHub for HW_* repos. Thereby, it considers users/organisations that forked the ScopeFoundry Repo.

To contribute follow [instructions here](docs/100_development/22_publishing_hw/).
