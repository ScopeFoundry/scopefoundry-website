The Overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the
size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or
put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy
User Guide).

Try answering these questions for your user in this page:

## What is it?

ScopeFoundry is an open-source alternative to LabView or MATLAB instrument control software.


**Features**: 

* Modular, cross-platform Python graphical interface allows for fast data acquisition and visualization
* Build lab equipment graphical interfaces interactively with Qt Creator
* Live updates of measurement code for fast development and debugging
* Hardware plug-ins for simple and complex scientific equipment

**Uses**
* Currently used in multi-modal scanning microscopy measurements with electrons and optics
* Flexible for many other data acquisition tasks

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

- [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/): Get started with ScopeFoundry.
- [Examples](/docs/examples/): Check out some example code!
