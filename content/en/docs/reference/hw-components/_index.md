This page periodically scans github for HW_* repos. Thereby, it considers users/organisations that forked the ScopeFoundry Repo.

So to share your hardware:

1. make a github account
2. Fork [ScopeFoundry repo](https://github.com/ScopeFoundry/ScopeFoundry) to your github account
3. Follow [packaging instructions](/docs/guides/hardware-packaging)

and this page should find your hardware.

Thanks.
