The following is a list of hardware component plug-ins created for use with ScopeFoundry. If you have a device you would like to use with ScopeFoundry and it is not listed below, you can create a custom hardware plug-in [from the following instructions](/docs/10_tutorials/2_hardware-1)

This page periodically crawls GitHub for HW_* repos. Thereby, it considers users/organisations that forked the ScopeFoundry Repo.

In order to share your ScopeFoundry hardware component:

1. Create an account on GitHub
2. Fork the [ScopeFoundry repo](https://github.com/ScopeFoundry/ScopeFoundry) to your github account
3. Follow [packaging instructions](/docs/guides/hardware-packaging)

and this page should find your hardware.

Thanks.
